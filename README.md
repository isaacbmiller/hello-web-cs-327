## Introduction

This is my personal website based off of the Vercel Precedent template. I'm using it to learn Next.js, Prisma, and PostGres.

This was created as a part of the NU CS 327 Class.

You can also clone & create this repo locally with the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app precedent --example "https://github.com/isaacbmiller/precedent"
```
